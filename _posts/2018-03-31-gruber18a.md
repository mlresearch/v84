title: Factorial HMMs with Collapsed Gibbs Sampling for Optimizing Long-term HIV Therapy
abstract: 'Combined antiretroviral therapies can successfully suppress HIV in the
  serum and bring its viral load below detection rate. However, drug resistance remains
  a major challenge. As resistance patterns vary between patients, therapy personalization
  is required. Automatic systems for therapy personalization exist and were shown
  to better predict therapy outcome than HIV experts in some settings. However, these
  systems focus only on selecting the therapy most likely to suppress the virus for
  several weeks, a choice that may be suboptimal over the longer term due to evolution
  of drug resistance. We present a novel generative model for HIV drug resistance
  evolution. This model is based on factorial HMMs, applying a novel collapsed Gibbs
  Sampling algorithm for approximate learning. Using the suggested model, we obtain
  better therapy outcome predictions than existing methods and recommend therapies
  that may be more effective in the long term. We demonstrate our results using simulated
  data and using real data from the EuResist dataset. '
