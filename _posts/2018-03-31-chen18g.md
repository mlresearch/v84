title: Near-Optimal Machine Teaching via Explanatory Teaching Sets
abstract: Modern applications of machine teaching for humans often involve domain-specific,
  non- trivial target hypothesis classes. To facilitate understanding of the target
  hypothesis, it is crucial for the teaching algorithm to use examples which are interpretable
  to the human learner. In this paper, we propose NOTES, a principled framework for
  constructing interpretable teaching sets, utilizing explanations to accelerate the
  teaching process. Our algorithm is built upon a natural stochastic model of learners
  and a novel submodular surrogate objective function which greedily selects interpretable
  teaching examples. We prove that NOTES is competitive with the optimal explanation-based
  teaching strategy. We further instantiate NOTES with a specific hypothesis class,
  which can be viewed as an interpretable approximation of any hypothesis class, allowing
  us to handle complex hypothesis in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  NOTES on several image classification tasks, for both simulated and real human learners.
  Our experimental results suggest that by leveraging explanations, one can significantly
  speed up teaching.
