title: Optimal Cooperative Inference
abstract: 'Cooperative transmission of data fosters rapid accumulation of knowledge
  by efficiently combining experiences across learners. Although well studied in human
  learning and increasingly in machine learning, we lack formal frameworks through
  which we may reason about the benefits and limitations of cooperative inference.
  We present such a framework. We introduce novel indices for measuring the effectiveness
  of probabilistic and cooperative information transmission. We relate our indices
  to the well-known Teaching Dimension in deterministic settings. We prove conditions
  under which optimal cooperative inference can be achieved, including a representation
  theorem that constrains the form of inductive biases for learners optimized for
  cooperative inference. We conclude by demonstrating how these principles may inform
  the design of machine learning algorithms and discuss implications for human and
  machine learning. '
