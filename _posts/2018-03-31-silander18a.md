title: Quotient Normalized Maximum Likelihood Criterion for Learning Bayesian Network
  Structures
abstract: We introduce an information theoretic criterion for Bayesian network structure
  learning which we call quotient normalized maximum likelihood (qNML). In contrast
  to the closely related factorized normalized maximum likelihood criterion, qNML
  satisfies the property of score equivalence. It is also decomposable and completely
  free of adjustable hyperparameters. For practical computations, we identify a remarkably
  accurate approximation proposed earlier by Szpankowski and Weinberger. Experiments
  on both simulated and real data demonstrate that the new criterion leads to parsimonious
  models with good predictive accuracy.
