title: Bayesian Approaches to Distribution Regression
abstract: Distribution regression has recently attracted much interest as a generic
  solution to the problem of supervised learning where labels are available at the
  group level, rather than at the individual level. Current approaches, however, do
  not propagate the uncertainty in observations due to sampling variability in the
  groups. This effectively assumes that small and large groups are estimated equally
  well, and should have equal weight in the final regression. We account for this
  uncertainty with a Bayesian distribution regression formalism, improving the robustness
  and performance of the model when group sizes vary. We frame our models in a neural
  network style, allowing for simple MAP inference using backpropagation to learn
  the parameters, as well as MCMC-based inference which can fully propagate uncertainty.
  We demonstrate our approach on illustrative toy datasets, as well as on a challenging
  problem of predicting age from images.
