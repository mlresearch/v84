title: Reparameterizing the Birkhoff Polytope for Variational Permutation Inference
abstract: " Many matching, tracking, sorting, and ranking problems require probabilistic
  reasoning about possible permutations, a set that grows factorially with dimension.
  Combinatorial optimization algorithms may enable efficient point estimation, but
  fully Bayesian inference poses a severe challenge in this high-dimensional, discrete
  space. To surmount this challenge, we start by relaxing the discrete set of permutation
  matrices to its convex hull the Birkhoff polytope, the set of doubly-stochastic
  matrices.  We then introduce two novel transformations: an invertible and differentiable
  stick-breaking procedure that maps unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope,
  and a map that rounds points toward the vertices of the polytope.  Both transformations
  include a temperature parameter that, in the limit, concentrates the densities on
  permutation matrices. We exploit these transformations and reparameterization gradients
  to introduce variational inference over permutation matrices, and we demonstrate
  its utility in a series of experiments. "
