title: 'Random Warping Series: A Random Features Method for Time-Series Embedding'
abstract: Time series data analytics has been a problem of substantial interests for
  decades, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has been the most widely adopted technique
  to measure dissimilarity between time series. A number of global-alignment kernels
  have since been proposed in the spirit of DTW to extend its use to kernel-based
  estimation method such as support vector machine. However, those kernels suffer
  from diagonal dominance of the Gram matrix and a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the
  sample size. In this work, we study a family of alignment-aware positive definite
  (p.d.) kernels, with its feature embedding given by a distribution of Random Warping
  Series (RWS). The proposed kernel does not suffer from the issue of diagonal dominance
  while naturally enjoys a Random Features (RF) approximation, which reduces the computational
  complexity of existing DTW-based techniques from quadratic to linear in terms of
  both the number and the length of time-series. We also study the convergence of
  the RF approximation for the domain of time series of unbounded length. Our extensive
  experiments on 16 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RWS outperforms or matches
  state-of-the-art classification and clustering methods in both accuracy and computational
  time.
