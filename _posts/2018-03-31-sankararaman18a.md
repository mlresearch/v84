title: Combinatorial Semi-Bandits with Knapsacks
abstract: 'We unify two prominent lines of work on multi-armed bandits: bandits with
  knapsacks (BwK) and combinatorial semi-bandits. The former concerns limited “resources"
  consumed by the algorithm, e.g., limited supply in dynamic pricing. The latter allows
  a huge number of actions but assumes combinatorial structure and additional feedback
  to make the problem tractable. We define a common generalization, support it with
  several motivating examples, and design an algorithm for it. Our regret bounds are
  comparable with those for BwK and combinatorial semi-bandits. '
