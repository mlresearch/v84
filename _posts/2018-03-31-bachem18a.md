title: 'One-shot Coresets: The Case of k-Clustering'
abstract: Scaling clustering algorithms to massive data sets is a challenging task.
  Recently, several successful approaches based on data summarization methods, such
  as coresets and sketches, were proposed. While these techniques provide provably
  good and small summaries, they are inherently problem dependent - the practitioner
  has to commit to a fixed clustering objective before even exploring the data. However,
  can one construct small data summaries for a wide range of clustering problems simultaneously?
  In this work, we affirmatively answer this question by proposing an efficient algorithm
  that constructs such one-shot summaries for k-clustering problems while retaining
  strong theoretical guarantees.
