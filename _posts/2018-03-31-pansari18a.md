title: Optimal Submodular Extensions for Marginal Estimation
abstract: Submodular extensions of an energy function can be used to efficiently compute
  approximate marginals via variational inference. The accuracy of the marginals depends
  crucially on the quality of the submodular extension. To identify the best possible
  extension, we show an equivalence between the submodular extensions of the energy
  and the objective functions of linear programming (LP) relaxations for the corresponding
  MAP estimation problem. This allows us to (i) establish the optimality of the submodular
  extension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the optimal submodular
  extension for the more general class of metric labeling; and (iii) efficiently compute
  the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model using a recently proposed Gaussian
  filtering method. Using both synthetic and real data, we show that our approach
  provides comparable upper bounds on the log-partition function to those obtained
  using tree-reweighted message passing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally
  feasible. Importantly, unlike TRW, our approach provides the first practical algorithm
  to compute an upper bound on the dense CRF model.
