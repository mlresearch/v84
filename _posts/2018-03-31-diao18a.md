title: Sketching for Kronecker Product Regression and P-splines
abstract: TensorSketch is an oblivious linear sketch introduced in (Pagh, 2013) and
  later used in (Pham and Pagh, 2013) in the context of SVMs for polynomial kernels.
  It was shown in (Avron et al., 2014) that TensorSketch provides a subspace embedding,
  and therefore can be used for canonical correlation analysis, low rank approximation,
  and principal component regression for the polynomial kernel. We take TensorSketch
  outside of the context of polynomials kernels, and show its utility in applications
  in which the underlying design matrix is a Kronecker product of smaller matrices.
  This allows us to solve Kronecker product regression and non-negative Kronecker
  product regression, as well as regularized spline regression. Our main technical
  result is then in extending TensorSketch to other norms. That is, TensorSketch only
  provides input sparsity time for Kronecker product regression with respect to the
  2-norm. We show how to solve Kronecker product regression with respect to the 1-norm
  in time sublinear in the time required for computing the Kronecker product, as well
  as for more general p-norms.
