title: Semi-Supervised Prediction-Constrained Topic Models
abstract: 'Supervisory signals can help topic models discover low-dimensional data
  representations which are useful for a specific prediction task. We propose a framework
  for training supervised latent Dirichlet allocation that balances two goals: faithful
  generative explanations of high-dimensional data and accurate prediction of associated
  class labels. Existing approaches fail to balance these goals by not properly handling
  a fundamental asymmetry: the intended application is always predicting labels from
  data, not data from labels. Our new prediction-constrained objective for training
  generative models coherently integrates supervisory signals even when only a small
  fraction of training examples are labeled. We demonstrate improved prediction quality
  compared to previous supervised topic models, achieving results competitive with
  high-dimensional logistic regression on text analysis and electronic health records
  tasks while simultaneously learning interpretable topics. '
