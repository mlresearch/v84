title: Scalable Hash-Based Estimation of Divergence Measures
abstract: We propose a scalable divergence estimation method based on hashing. Consider
  two continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ whose densities have bounded support.
  We consider a particular locality sensitive random hashing, and consider the ratio
  of samples in each hash bin having non-zero numbers of Y samples. We prove that
  the weighted average of these ratios over all of the hash bins converges to f-divergences
  between the two samples sets. We derive the MSE rates for two families of smooth
  functions; the Hölder smoothness class and differentiable functions. In particular,
  it is proved that if the density functions have bounded derivatives up to the order
  $d$, where $d$ is the dimension of samples, the optimal parametric MSE rate of $O(1/N)$
  can be achieved.  The computational complexity is shown to be $O(N)$, which is optimal.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical divergence estimator that
  has optimal computational complexity and can achieve the optimal parametric MSE
  estimation rate of $O(1/N)$.
