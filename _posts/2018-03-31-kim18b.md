title: Nonparametric Sharpe Ratio Function Estimation in Heteroscedastic Regression
  Models via Convex Optimization
abstract: We consider maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of heteroscedastic regression
  models based on a new “parametrization” of the likelihood in terms of the Sharpe
  ratio function, or the ratio of the mean and volatility functions. While with a
  standard parametrization the MLE problem is not convex and hence hard to solve globally,
  our parametrization leads to a functional that is jointly convex in the Sharpe ratio
  and inverse volatility functions. The major difficulty with the resulting infinite-dimensional
  convex program is the shape constraint on the inverse volatility function. We propose
  to solve the problem by solving a sequence of finite-dimensional convex programs
  with increasing dimensions, which can be done globally and efficiently. We demonstrate
  that, when the goal is to estimate the Sharpe ratio function directly, the finite-sample
  performance of the proposed estimation method is superior to existing methods that
  estimate the mean and variance functions separately. When applied to a financial
  dataset, our method captures a well-known covariate-dependent effect on the Shape
  ratio.
