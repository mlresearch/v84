title: Matrix-normal models for fMRI analysis
abstract: 'Multivariate analysis of fMRI data has bene- fited substantially from advances
  in machine learning. Most recently, a range of prob- abilistic latent variable models
  applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of tasks, including identifying
  similarity pat- terns in neural data, combining multi-subject datasets, and mapping
  between brain and be- havior. Although these methods share some underpinnings, they
  have been developed as distinct methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools.
  We show how the matrix- variate normal (MN) formalism can unify some of these methods
  into a single frame- work. In doing so, we gain the ability to reuse noise modeling
  assumptions, algorithms, and code across models. Our primary theoretical contribution
  shows how some of these meth- ods can be written as instantiations of the same model,
  allowing us to generalize them to flexibly modeling structured noise covari- ances.
  Our formalism permits novel model variants and improved estimation strategies for
  SRM and RSA using substantially fewer parameters. We empirically demonstrate ad-
  vantages of our two new methods: for MN-RSA, we show up to 10x improvement in run-
  time, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and more conservative behavior under the null.
  For MN-SRM, our method grants a modest improvement to out-of-sample reconstruction
  while relaxing the orthonormality constraint of SRM. We also provide a software
  prototyp- ing tool for MN models that can flexibly reuse noise covariance assumptions
  and algorithms across models.'
