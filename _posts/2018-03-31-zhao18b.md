title: Bayesian Multi-label Learning with Sparse Features and Labels, and Label Co-occurrences
abstract: 'We present a probabilistic, fully Bayesian framework for multi-label learning.
  Our framework is based on the idea of learning a joint low-rank embedding of the
  label matrix and the label co-occurrence matrix. The proposed framework has the
  following appealing aspects: (1) It leverages the sparsity in the label matrix and
  the feature matrix, which results in very efficient inference, especially for sparse
  datasets, commonly encountered in multi-label learning problems, and (2) By effectively
  utilizing the label co-occurrence information, the model yields improved prediction
  accuracies, especially in the case where the amount of training data is low and/or
  the label matrix has a significant fraction of missing labels. Our framework enjoys
  full local conjugacy and admits a simple inference procedure via a scalable Gibbs
  sampler. We report experimental results on a number of benchmark datasets, on which
  it outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-label learning models.'
