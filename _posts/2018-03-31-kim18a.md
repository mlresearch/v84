title: 'Scaling up the Automatic Statistician: Scalable Structure Discovery using
  Gaussian Processes'
abstract: Automating statistical modelling is a challenging problem in artificial
  intelligence. The Automatic Statistician employs a kernel search algorithm using
  Gaussian Processes (GP) to provide interpretable statistical models for regression
  problems. However this does not scale due to its O(N^3) running time for the model
  selection. We propose Scalable Kernel Composition (SKC), a scalable kernel search
  algorithm that extends the Automatic Statistician to bigger data sets. In doing
  so, we derive a cheap upper bound on the GP marginal likelihood that is used in
  SKC with the variational lower bound to sandwich the marginal likelihood. We show
  that the upper bound is significantly tighter than the lower bound and useful for
  model selection.
