title: Parallelised Bayesian Optimisation via Thompson Sampling
abstract: 'We design and analyse variations of the classical Thompson sampling (TS)
  procedure for Bayesian optimisation (BO) in settings where function evaluations
  are expensive but can be performed in parallel. Our theoretical analysis shows that
  a direct application of the sequential Thompson sampling algorithm in either synchronous
  or asynchronous parallel settings yields a surprisingly powerful result: making
  $n$ evaluations distributed among $M$ workers is essentially equivalent to performing
  $n$ evaluations in sequence. Further, by modelling the time taken to complete a
  function evaluation, we show that, under a time constraint, asynchronous parallel
  TS achieves asymptotically lower regret than both the synchronous and sequential
  versions. These results are complemented by an experimental analysis, showing that
  asynchronous TS outperforms a suite of existing parallel BO algorithms in simulations
  and in an application involving tuning hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural
  network. In addition to these, the proposed procedure is conceptually much simpler
  than existing work for parallel BO.'
