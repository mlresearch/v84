title: Symmetric Variational Autoencoder and Connections to Adversarial Learning
abstract: A new form of the variational autoencoder (VAE) is proposed, based on the
  symmetric Kullback- Leibler divergence. It is demonstrated that learn- ing of the
  resulting symmetric VAE (sVAE) has close connections to previously developed adversarial-learning
  methods. This relationship helps unify the previously distinct techniques of VAE
  and adversarially learning, and provides insights that allow us to ameliorate shortcomings
  with some previously developed adversarial methods. In addition to an analysis that
  motivates and explains the sVAE, an extensive set of experiments validate the utility
  of the approach.
