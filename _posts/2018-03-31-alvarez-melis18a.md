title: Structured Optimal Transport
abstract: Optimal Transport has recently gained interest in machine learning for applications
  ranging from domain adaptation to sentence similarities or deep learning. Yet, its
  ability to capture frequently occurring structure beyond the "ground metric" is
  limited. In this work, we develop a nonlinear generalization of (discrete) optimal
  transport that is able to reflect much additional structure. We demonstrate how
  to leverage the geometry of this new model for fast algorithms, and explore connections
  and properties.  Illustrative experiments highlight the benefit of the induced structured
  couplings for tasks in domain adaptation and natural language processing.
