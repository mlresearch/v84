title: A Generic Approach for Escaping Saddle points
abstract: A central challenge to using first-order methods for optimizing nonconvex
  problems is the presence of saddle points. First-order methods often get stuck at
  saddle points, greatly deteriorating their performance. Typically, to escape from
  saddles one has to use second-order methods. However, most works on second-order
  methods rely extensively on expensive Hessian-based computations, making them impractical
  in large-scale settings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a generic framework
  that minimizes Hessian-based computations while at the same time provably converging
  to second-order critical points. Our framework carefully alternates between a first-order
  and a second-order subroutine, using the latter only close to saddle points, and
  yields convergence results competitive to the state-of-the-art. Empirical results
  suggest that our strategy also enjoys a good practical performance.
