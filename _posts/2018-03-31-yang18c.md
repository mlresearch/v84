title: Dimensionality Reduced $\ell^{0}$-Sparse Subspace Clustering
abstract: Subspace clustering partitions the data that lie on a union of subspaces.
  $\ell^{0}$-Sparse Subspace Clustering ($\ell^{0}$-SSC), which belongs to the subspace
  clustering methods with sparsity prior, guarantees the correctness of subspace clustering
  under less restrictive assumptions compared to its $\ell^{1}$ counterpart such as
  Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC, Elhamifar et al., 2013) with demonstrated effectiveness
  in practice. In this paper, we present Dimensionality Reduced $\ell^{0}$-Sparse
  Subspace Clustering (DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC). DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC first projects the data
  onto a lower dimensional space by linear transformation, then performs $\ell^{0}$-SSC
  on the dimensionality reduced data. The correctness of DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC in terms
  of the subspace detection property is proved, therefore DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC recovers
  the underlying subspace structure in the original data from the dimensionality reduced
  data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC.
