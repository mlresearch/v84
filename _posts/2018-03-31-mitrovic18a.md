title: 'Submodularity on Hypergraphs: From Sets to Sequences'
abstract: In a nutshell, submodular functions encode an intuitive notion of diminishing
  returns. As a result, submodularity appears in many important machine learning tasks
  such as feature selection and data summarization. Although there has been a large
  volume of work devoted to the study of submodular functions in recent years, the
  vast majority of this work has been focused on algorithms that output sets, not
  sequences. However, in many settings, the order in which we output items can be
  just as important as the items themselves. To extend the notion of submodularity
  to sequences, we use a directed graph on the items where the edges encode the additional
  value of selecting items in a particular order. Existing theory is limited to the
  case where this underlying graph is a directed acyclic graph. In this paper, we
  introduce two new algorithms that provably give constant factor approximations for
  general graphs and hypergraphs having bounded in or out degrees. Furthermore, we
  show the utility of our new algorithms for real-world applications in movie recommendation,
  online link prediction, and the design of course sequences for MOOCs.
