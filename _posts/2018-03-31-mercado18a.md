title: The Power Mean Laplacian for Multilayer Graph Clustering
abstract: Multilayer graphs encode different kind of interactions between the same
  set of entities. When one wants to cluster such a multilayer graph, the natural
  question arises how one should merge the information from different layers. We introduce
  in this paper a one-parameter family of matrix power means for merging the Laplacians
  from different layers and analyze it in expectation in the stochastic block model.
  We show that this family allows to recover ground truth clusters under different
  settings and verify this in real world data. While the matrix power mean is computationally
  expensive to compute we introduce a scalable numerical scheme that allows to efficiently
  compute the eigenvectors of the matrix power mean of large sparse graphs.
