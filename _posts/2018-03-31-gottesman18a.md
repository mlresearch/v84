title: Weighted Tensor Decomposition for Learning Latent Variables with Partial Data
abstract: Tensor decomposition methods are popular tools for learning latent variables
  given only lowerorder moments of the data. However, the standard assumption is that
  we have sufficient data to estimate these moments to high accuracy. In this work,
  we consider the case in which certain dimensions of the data are not always observed–common
  in applied settings, where not all measurements may be taken for all observations–resulting
  in moment estimates of varying quality. We derive a weighted tensor decomposition
  approach that is computationally as efficient as the non-weighted approach, and
  demonstrate that it outperforms methods that do not appropriately leverage these
  less-observed dimensions.
