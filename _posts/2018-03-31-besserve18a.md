title: Group invariance principles for causal generative models
abstract: The postulate of independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) has recently
  led to several new causal discovery algorithms. The interpretation of independence
  and the way it is utilized, however, varies across these methods. Our aim in this
  paper is to propose a group theoretic framework for ICM to unify and generalize
  these approaches. In our setting, the cause-mechanism relationship is assessed by
  perturbing it with random group transformations. We show that the group theoretic
  view encompasses previous ICM approaches and provides a very general tool to study
  the structure of data generating mechanisms with direct applications to machine
  learning.
