title: Variational Inference based on Robust Divergences
abstract: Robustness to outliers is a central issue in real-world machine learning
  applications. While replacing a model to a heavy-tailed one (e.g., from Gaussian
  to Student-t)  is a standard approach for robustification, it can only be applied
  to simple models. In this paper, based on Zellner’s optimization and variational
  formulation of Bayesian inference, we propose an outlier-robust pseudo-Bayesian
  variational method by replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence used for data fitting
  to a robust divergence such as the beta- and gamma-divergences. An advantage of
  our approach is that superior but complex models such as deep networks can also
  be handled. We theoretically prove that, for deep networks with ReLU activation
  functions, the influence function in our proposed method is bounded, while it is
  unbounded in the ordinary variational inference. This implies that our proposed
  method is robust to both of input and output outliers, while the ordinary variational
  method is not. We experimentally demonstrate that our robust variational method
  outperforms ordinary variational inference in regression and classification with
  deep networks.
