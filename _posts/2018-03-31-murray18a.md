title: Delayed Sampling and Automatic Rao-Blackwellization of Probabilistic Programs
abstract: We introduce a dynamic mechanism for the solution of analytically-tractable
  substructure in probabilistic programs, using conjugate priors and affine transformations
  to reduce variance in Monte Carlo estimators. For inference with Sequential Monte
  Carlo, this automatically yields improvements such as locally-optimal proposals
  and Rao–Blackwellization. The mechanism maintains a directed graph alongside the
  running program that evolves dynamically as operations are triggered upon it. Nodes
  of the graph represent random variables, edges the analytically-tractable relationships
  between them. Random variables remain in the graph for as long as possible, to be
  sampled only when they are used by the program in a way that cannot be resolved
  analytically. In the meantime, they are conditioned on as many observations as possible.
  We demonstrate the mechanism with a few pedagogical examples, as well as a linear-nonlinear
  state-space model with simulated data, and an epidemiological model with real data
  of a dengue outbreak in Micronesia. In all cases one or more variables are automatically
  marginalized out to significantly reduce variance in estimates of the marginal likelihood,
  in the final case facilitating a random-weight or pseudo-marginal-type importance
  sampler for parameter estimation. We have implemented the approach in Anglican and
  a new probabilistic programming language called Birch.
