title: Temporally-Reweighted Chinese Restaurant Process Mixtures for Clustering, Imputing,
  and Forecasting Multivariate Time Series
abstract: This article proposes a Bayesian nonparametric method for forecasting, imputation,
  and clustering in sparsely observed, multivariate time series data. The method is
  appropriate for jointly modeling hundreds of time series with widely varying, non-stationary
  dynamics. Given a collection of $N$ time series, the Bayesian model first partitions
  them into independent clusters using a Chinese restaurant process prior. Within
  a cluster, all time series are modeled jointly using a novel “temporally-reweighted”
  extension of the Chinese restaurant process mixture. Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques
  are used to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, which are then used
  to form predictive inferences. We apply the technique to challenging forecasting
  and imputation tasks using seasonal flu data from the US Center for Disease Control
  and Prevention, demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy and competitive imputation
  accuracy as compared to multiple widely used baselines. We further show that the
  model discovers interpretable clusters in datasets with hundreds of time series,
  using macroeconomic data from the Gapminder Foundation.
