title: Variational Rejection Sampling
abstract: Learning latent variable models with stochastic variational inference is
  challenging when the approximate posterior is far from the true posterior, due to
  high variance in the gradient estimates. We propose a novel rejection sampling step
  that discards samples from the variational posterior which are assigned low likelihoods
  by the model. Our approach provides an arbitrarily accurate approximation of the
  true posterior at the expense of extra computation. Using a new gradient estimator
  for the resulting unnormalized proposal distribution, we achieve average improvements
  of 3.71 nats and 0.31 nats over state-of-the-art single-sample and multi-sample
  alternatives respectively for estimating marginal log-likelihoods using sigmoid
  belief networks on the MNIST dataset. We show both theoretically and empirically
  how explicitly rejecting samples, while seemingly challenging to analyze due to
  the implicit nature of the resulting unnormalized proposal distribution, can have
  benefits over the competing state-of-the-art alternatives based on importance weighting.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach via experiments on synthetic
  data and a benchmark density estimation task with sigmoid belief networks over the
  MNIST dataset.
