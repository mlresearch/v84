title: Riemannian stochastic quasi-Newton algorithm with variance reduction and its
  convergence analysis
abstract: 'Stochastic variance reduction algorithms have recently become popular for
  minimizing the average of a large, but finite number of loss functions. The present
  paper proposes a Riemannian stochastic quasi-Newton algorithm with variance reduction
  (R-SQN-VR). The key challenges of averaging, adding, and subtracting multiple gradients
  are addressed with notions of retraction and vector transport. We present convergence
  analyses of R-SQN-VR on both non-convex and retraction-convex functions under retraction
  and vector transport operators. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the Karcher
  mean computation on the symmetric positive-definite manifold and the low-rank matrix
  completion on the Grassmann manifold. In all cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms
  the state-of-the-art Riemannian batch and stochastic gradient algorithms. '
