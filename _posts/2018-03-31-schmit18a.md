title: Human Interaction with Recommendation Systems
abstract: 'Many recommendation algorithms rely on user data to generate recommendations.
  However, these recommendations also affect the data obtained from future users.
  This work aims to understand the effects of this dynamic interaction. We propose
  a simple model where users with heterogeneous preferences arrive over time. Based
  on this model, we prove that naive estimators, i.e. those which ignore this feedback
  loop, are not consistent. We show that consistent estimators are efficient in the
  presence of myopic agents. Our results are validated using extensive simulations. '
