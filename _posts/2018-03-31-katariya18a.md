title: Adaptive Sampling for Coarse Ranking
abstract: We consider the problem of active coarse ranking, where the goal is to sort
  items according to their means into clusters of pre-specified sizes, by adaptively
  sampling from their reward distributions.  This setting is useful in many social
  science applications involving human raters and the approximate rank of every item
  is desired. Approximate or coarse ranking can significantly reduce the number of
  ratings required in comparison to the number needed to find an exact ranking. We
  propose a computationally efficient PAC algorithm LUCBRank for coarse ranking, and
  derive an upper bound on its sample complexity. We also derive a nearly matching
  distribution-dependent lower bound. Experiments on synthetic as well as real-world
  data show that LUCBRank performs better than state-of-the-art baseline methods,
  even when these methods have the advantage of knowing the underlying parametric
  model.
