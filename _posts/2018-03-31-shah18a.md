title: Reducing Crowdsourcing to Graphon Estimation, Statistically
abstract: 'Inferring the correct answers to binary tasks based on multiple noisy answers
  in an unsupervised manner has emerged as the canonical question for micro-task crowdsourcing
  or more generally aggregating opinions. In graphon estimation, one is interested
  in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes using a single snapshot
  of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there has been exciting development
  within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual
  challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised
  by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon
  estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest.   In
  this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation
  to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from graphon
  estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than the majority
  voting scheme for a setup that goes beyond the rank one models considered in the
  literature. We use known lower bounds for crowdsourcing to derive lower bounds for
  graphon estimation. '
