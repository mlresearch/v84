title: Approximate ranking from pairwise comparisons
abstract: 'A common problem in machine learning is to rank a set of n items based
  on pairwise comparison. Here, ranking refers to partitioning the items into sets
  of pre-specified sizes according to theirs scores, which includes identification
  of the top-k items as the most prominent special case.  The score of a given item
  is defined as the probability that it beats a randomly chosen other item.  In practice,
  in particular when n is large, finding an exact ranking typically requires a prohibitively
  large number of comparisons. What comes to our rescue here is that in practice,
  one is usually content with finding an approximate ranking. In this paper we consider
  the problem of finding approximate rankings from pairwise comparisons. We analyze
  an active ranking algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and decides
  whether to stop or which pair of items to compare next, based on confidence intervals
  computed from the data collected in previous steps. We show that this algorithm
  succeeds in recovering approximate rankings using a number of comparisons that is
  close to optimal up to logarithmic factors. We also present numerical results, showing
  that in practice, approximation can drastically reduce the number of comparisons
  required to estimate a ranking. '
