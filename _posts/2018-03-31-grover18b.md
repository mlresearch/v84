title: Best arm identification in multi-armed bandits with delayed feedback
abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalization of the best arm identification
  problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) to the setting where every pull
  of an arm is associated with delayed feedbacks. The delay in feedbacks increases
  the effective sample complexity of the algorithm, but can be offset by partial feedbacks  received
  before a pull is completed. We propose a a general modeling framework to structure
  in the partial feedbacks, and as a special case we introduce efficient algorithms
  for best arm identification in settings where the partial feedbacks are biased or
  unbiased estimators of the final outcome of the pull. Additionally, we propose a
  novel extension of the algorithms to the parallel MAB setting where an agent can
  control a batch of arms. Experiments on simulated as well as real world datasets
  of policy search for charging chemical batteries and hyperparameter optimization
  for mixed integer programming demonstrate that exploiting the structure of partial
  and delayed feedbacks can lead to significant improvements over baselines on both
  sequential and parallel MAB.
