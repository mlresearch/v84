title: Conditional independence testing based on a nearest-neighbor estimator of conditional
  mutual information
abstract: Conditional independence testing is a fundamental problem underlying causal
  discovery and a particularly challenging task in the presence of nonlinear dependencies.
  Here a fully non-parametric test for continuous data based on conditional mutual
  information combined with a local permutation scheme is presented. Numerical experiments
  covering sample sizes from $50$ to $2,000$ and dimensions up to $10$ demonstrate
  that the test reliably generates the null distribution. For smooth nonlinear dependencies,
  the test has higher power than kernel-based tests in lower dimensions and similar
  or slightly lower power in higher dimensions. For highly non-smooth densities the
  data-adaptive nearest neighbor approach is particularly well-suited while kernel
  methods yield much lower power. The experiments also show that kernel methods utilizing
  an analytical approximation of the null distribution are not well-calibrated for
  sample sizes below $1,000$. Combining the local permutation scheme with these kernel
  tests leads to better calibration but lower power.  For smaller sample sizes and
  lower dimensions, the proposed test is faster than random fourier feature-based
  kernel tests if (embarrassingly) parallelized, but the runtime increases more sharply
  with sample size and dimensionality. Thus, more theoretical research to analytically
  approximate the null distribution and speed up the estimation is desirable.  As
  illustrated on real data here, the test is ideally suited in combination with causal
  discovery algorithms.
