title: Online Ensemble Multi-kernel Learning Adaptive to Non-stationary and Adversarial
  Environments
abstract: Kernel-based methods exhibit well-documented performance in various nonlinear
  learning tasks. Most of them rely on a preselected kernel, whose prudent choice
  presumes task-specific prior information. To cope with this limitation, multi-kernel
  learning has gained popularity thanks to its flexibility in choosing kernels from
  a prescribed kernel dictionary. Leveraging the random feature approximation and
  its recent orthogonality-promoting variant, the present contribution develops an
  online multi-kernel learning scheme to infer the intended nonlinear function ‘on
  the fly.’ To further boost performance in non-stationary environments, an adaptive
  multi-kernel learning scheme is developed with affordable computation and memory
  complexity. Performance is analyzed in terms of both static and dynamic regret.
  To our best knowledge, AdaRaker is the first algorithm that can optimally track
  nonlinear functions in non-stationary settings with strong theoretical guarantees.
  Numerical tests on real datasets are carried out to showcase the effectiveness of
  the proposed algorithms.
