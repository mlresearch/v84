title: Post Selection Inference with Kernels
abstract: 'Finding a set of statistically significant features from complex data (e.g.,
  nonlinear and/or multi-dimensional output data) is important for scientific discovery
  and has a number of practical applications including biomarker discovery. In this
  paper, we propose a kernel-based post-selection inference (PSI) algorithm that can
  find a set of statistically significant features from non-linearly related data.
  Specifically, our PSI algorithm is based on independence measures, and we call it
  the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)-based PSI algorithm (hsicInf).
  The novelty of hsicInf is that it can handle non-linearity and/or multi-variate/multi-class
  outputs through kernels. Through synthetic experiments, we show that hsicInf  can
  find a set of  statistically significant features for both regression and classification
  problems. We applied hsicInf to real-world datasets and show that it can successfully
  identify important features. '
