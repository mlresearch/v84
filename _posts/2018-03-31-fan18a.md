title: 'Statistical Sparse Online Regression: A Diffusion Approximation Perspective'
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose to adopt the diffusion approximation techniques
  to study online regression. The diffusion approximation techniques allow us to characterize
  the exact dynamics of the online regression process. As a consequence, we obtain
  the optimal statistical rate of convergence up to a logarithmic factor of the streaming
  sample size. Using the idea of trajectory averaging, we further improve the rate
  of convergence by eliminating the logarithmic factor. Lastly, we propose a two-step
  algorithm for sparse online regression: a burn-in step using offline learning and
  a refinement step using a variant of truncated stochastic gradient descent. Under
  appropriate assumptions, we show the proposed algorithm produces near optimal sparse
  estimators. Numerical experiments lend further support to our obtained theory.'
