title: Smooth and Sparse Optimal Transport
abstract: Entropic regularization is quickly emerging as a new standard in optimal
  transport (OT). It enables to cast the OT computation as a differentiable and unconstrained
  convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Sinkhorn
  algorithm. However, entropy keeps the transportation plan strictly positive and
  therefore completely dense, unlike unregularized OT. This lack of sparsity can be
  problematic in applications where the transportation plan itself is of interest.
  In this paper, we explore regularizing the primal and dual OT formulations with
  a strongly convex term, which corresponds to relaxing the dual and primal constraints
  with smooth approximations. We show how to incorporate squared $2$-norm and group
  lasso regularizations within that framework, leading to sparse and group-sparse
  transportation plans.  On the theoretical side, we bound the approximation error
  introduced by regularizing the primal and dual formulations. Our results suggest
  that, for the regularized primal, the approximation error can often be smaller with
  squared $2$-norm than with entropic regularization.  We showcase our proposed framework
  on the task of color transfer.
