title: Teacher Improves Learning by Selecting a Training Subset
abstract: 'We call a learner super-teachable if a teacher can trim down an iid training
  set while making the learner learn even better. We provide sharp super-teaching
  guarantees on two learners: the maximum likelihood estimator for the mean of a Gaussian,
  and the large margin classifier in 1D. For general learners, we provide a mixed-integer
  nonlinear programming-based algorithm to find a super teaching set. Empirical experiments
  show that our algorithm is able to find good super-teaching sets for both regression
  and classification problems. '
