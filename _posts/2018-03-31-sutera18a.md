title: Random Subspace with Trees for Feature Selection Under Memory Constraints
abstract: Dealing with datasets of very high dimension is a major challenge in machine
  learning. In this paper, we consider the problem of feature selection in applications
  where the memory is not large enough to contain all features. In this setting, we
  propose a novel tree-based feature selection approach that builds a sequence of
  randomized trees on small subsamples of variables mixing both variables already
  identified as relevant by previous models and variables randomly selected among
  the other variables. As our main contribution, we provide an in-depth theoretical
  analysis of this method in infinite sample setting. In particular, we study its
  soundness with respect to common definitions of feature relevance and its convergence
  speed under various variable dependance scenarios. We also provide some preliminary
  empirical results highlighting the potential of the approach.
