title: Product Kernel Interpolation for Scalable Gaussian Processes
abstract: Recent work shows that inference for Gaussian processes can be performed
  efficiently using iterative methods that rely only on matrix-vector multiplications
  (MVMs). Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) exploits these techniques by deriving
  approximate kernels with very fast MVMs. Unfortunately, such strategies suffer badly
  from the curse of dimensionality. We develop a new technique for MVM based learning
  that exploits product kernel structure. We demonstrate that this technique is broadly
  applicable, resulting in linear rather than exponential runtime with dimension for
  SKI, as well as state-of-the-art asymptotic complexity for multi-task GPs
