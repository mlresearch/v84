title: Stochastic Zeroth-order Optimization in High Dimensions
abstract: 'We consider the problem of optimizing a high-dimensional convex function
  using stochastic zeroth-order queries. Under sparsity assumptions on the gradients
  or function values, we present two algorithms: a successive component/feature selection
  algorithm and a noisy mirror descent algorithm using Lasso gradient estimates, and
  show that both algorithms have convergence rates that depend only logarithmically
  on the ambient dimension of the problem. Empirical results confirm our theoretical
  findings and show that the algorithms we design outperform classical zeroth-order
  optimization methods in the high-dimensional setting.'
