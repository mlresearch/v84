title: Large Scale Empirical Risk Minimization via Truncated Adaptive Newton Method
abstract: Most second order methods are inapplicable to large scale empirical risk
  minimization (ERM) problems because both, the number of samples N and number of
  parameters p are large. Large N makes it costly to evaluate Hessians and large p
  makes it costly to invert Hessians. This paper propose a novel adaptive sample size
  second-order method, which reduces the cost of computing the Hessian by solving
  a sequence of ERM problems corresponding to a subset of samples and lowers the cost
  of computing the Hessian inverse using a truncated eigenvalue decomposition. Although
  the sample size is grown at a geometric rate, it is shown that it is sufficient
  to run a single iteration in each growth stage to track the optimal classifier to
  within its statistical accuracy. This results in convergence to the optimal classifier
  associated with the whole set in a number of iterations that scales with $\log(N)$.
  The use of a truncated eigenvalue decomposition result in the cost of each iteration
  being of order $p^2$. Theoretical performance gains manifest in practical implementations.
