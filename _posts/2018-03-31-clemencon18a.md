title: 'Beating Monte Carlo Integration: a Nonasymptotic Study of Kernel Smoothing
  Methods'
abstract: Evaluating integrals is an ubiquitous issue and Monte Carlo methods, exploiting
  advances in random number generation over the last decades, offer a popular and
  powerful alternative to integration deterministic techniques, unsuited in particular
  when the domain of integration is complex. This paper is devoted to the study of
  a kernel smoothing based competitor built from a sequence of $n≥1$ i.i.d random
  vectors with arbitrary continuous probability distribution $f(x)dx$, originally
  proposed in Delyon et al. (2016), from a nonasymptotic perspective. We establish
  a probability bound showing that the method under study, though biased, produces
  an estimate approximating the target integral $\int_{x∈\mathbb{R}^d}\varphi(x)dx$
  with an error bound of order $o(1/\sqrt{n})$ uniformly over a class $Φ$ of functions
  $\varphi$,  under weak complexity/smoothness assumptions related to the class $Φ$,
  outperforming Monte-Carlo procedures. This striking result is shown to derive from
  an appropriate decomposition of the maximal deviation between the target integrals
  and their estimates, highlighting the remarkable benefit to averaging strongly dependent
  terms regarding statistical accuracy in this situation. The theoretical analysis
  then rests on sharp probability inequalities for degenerate $U$-statistics. It is
  illustrated by numerical results in the context of covariate shift regression, providing
  empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach.
