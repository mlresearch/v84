title: Provable Estimation of the Number of Blocks in Block Models
abstract: Community detection is a fundamental unsupervised learning problem for unlabeled
  networks which has a broad range of applications. Many community detection algorithms
  assume that the number of clusters r is known apriori. In this paper, we propose
  an approach based on semi-definite relaxations, which does not require prior knowledge
  of model parameters like many existing convex relaxation methods and recovers the
  number of clusters and the clustering matrix exactly under a broad parameter regime,
  with probability tending to one. On a variety of simulated and real data experiments,
  we show that the proposed method often outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for
  estimating the number of clusters.
