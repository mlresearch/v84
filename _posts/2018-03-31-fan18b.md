title: The Binary Space Partitioning-Tree Process
abstract: The Mondrian process represents an elegant and powerful approach for space
  partition modelling. However, as it restricts the partitions to be axis-aligned,
  its modelling flexibility is limited. In this work, we propose a self-consistent
  Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)-Tree process to generalize the Mondrian process.
  The BSP-Tree process is an almost surely right continuous Markov jump process that
  allows uniformly distributed oblique cuts in a two-dimensional convex polygon. The
  BSP-Tree process can also be extended using a non-uniform probability measure to
  generate direction differentiated cuts. The process is also self-consistent, maintaining
  distributional invariance under a restricted subdomain. We use Conditional-Sequential
  Monte Carlo for inference using the tree structure as the high-dimensional variable.
  The BSP-Tree process’s performance on synthetic data partitioning and relational
  modelling demonstrates clear inferential improvements over the standard Mondrian
  process and other related methods.
