title: Spectral Algorithms for Computing Fair Support Vector Machines
abstract: Classifiers and rating scores are prone to implicitly codifying biases,
  which may be present in the training data, against protected classes (i.e., age,
  gender, or race). So it is important to understand how to design classifiers and
  scores that prevent discrimination in predictions.  This paper develops computationally
  tractable algorithms for designing accurate but fair support vector machines (SVM’s).  Our
  approach imposes a constraint on the covariance matrices conditioned on each protected
  class, which leads to a nonconvex quadratic constraint in the SVM formulation.  We
  develop iterative algorithms to compute fair linear and kernel SVM’s, which solve
  a sequence of relaxations constructed using a spectral decomposition of the nonconvex
  constraint. Its effectiveness in achieving high prediction accuracy while ensuring
  fairness is shown through numerical experiments on several data sets.
